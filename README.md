# Web Scraping Challenge

In this challenge, the goal was to scrape data from NASA's twitter account for the latest updates, pictures, and other information on the exploration of Mars. After scraping the data with Beautiful Soup, Requests, and Splinter, I was tasked with pushing the data onto a personal HTML webpage that I created. 

## Getting Started 

I am running this code out of my anaconda virtual environment and Jupyter Notebook. In order to run this code you will need the proper dependencies installed and "Chromedriver.exe" must be in the same folder.
